title: Haplo committee support
--

The Haplo Committee Support plugin provides support for managing committees, scheduling regular meetings and notifying members of upcoming meetings.

h2. Committee record

The main committee record page contains a list of upcoming meetings, past meetings and provides a link to schedule a new meeting specifically for the commitee rep.

When scheduling a new meeting, attendees are automatically populated from the committee record but gives the representative a chance to adjust this accordingly.

h2. Commitee meeting record

Each committee meeting page lists all applications that are scheduled to be discussed during the meeting.

Also enables members to attach other documents to the committee meeting.

h2. Notifications

Notifications are automatically sent to all attendees 7 days ahead of a meeting is due to take place. This includes the time and location of the meeting and an agenda of all applications to be discussed during the meeting.

Further notifications are sent if an item is added to the agenda after the initial 7 day notification is sent. Although this can be disabled per client by adding the "haplo_committee_support:disable_notifications_when_items_added" into their config.

If there are no attendees listed, it is only sent to the committee representatives with a note to notify anyone else accordingly.
